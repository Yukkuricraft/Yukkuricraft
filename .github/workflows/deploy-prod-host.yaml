# Note: This is a first iteration deployment pipeline. It's not particularly secure or robust.
# - Future iterations should consider a solution that doesn't require SSH'ing into the prod host, even if the
#   ssh'd user doesn't have sudo perms.
# - This might (probably) requires writing a deployer service that runs on the prod host, but that has its own
#   concerns such as bootstrapping, service failure recovery, complexity, etc.
